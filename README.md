# PTA Database of Manuscripts

At the moment, the database of manuscripts contains only rudimentary data on manuscripts which are transmitting works by Severian of Gabala. That data is widely based on the data provided by [Pinakes](https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/) and on handwritten notes by Karl-Heinz Uthemann. The data will be updated in the course of the critical edition of Severian's homilies.

In future, also manuscripts containing other texts edited in the project [„Alexandrinische und antiochenische Bibelexegese der Spätantike“](https://bibelexegese.bbaw.de) or published in the PTA will be added to the database.

All data is available under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).


This repository is work in progress. Please file issues with the texts [here](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_manuscripts/issues).
